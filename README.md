Experiment No. 3

Aim:

To study and implement different types of operators in C++.

Tools Required:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Theory:

Operators are special symbols in C++ used to perform operations on variables and values. C++ provides a rich set of built-in operators categorized as:

Arithmetic Operators : Used for mathematical operations.
Examples: +, -, *, /, %

syntax:

int a = 10, b = 5;

int sum = a + b;

Relational (Comparison) Operators : Used to compare two values.
Examples: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

syntax:

if (a > b) { cout << "a is greater"; }

Logical Operators : Used to combine conditional statements.

Examples: &&, ||, !

syntax:

if (a > b && b > 0) { // true if both conditions are true }

Assignment Operators : Assign values to variables.
Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=

Bitwise Operators : Used to perform operations on bits.

Examples: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Conclusion:

By performing this experiment:

You understood the various types of C++ operators and their uses.

You implemented multiple operator categories in programs (arithmetic, relational, logical).

You enhanced your problem-solving ability using expressions and conditional logic.
